**TinySite** is a progressively configurable build system for bundling static HTML, CSS, and JS assets. Unlike some static site generators, TinySite assumes very little about the structure of your project and offers a granular level of control when you choose to override configuration defaults. Unlike some component-based frameworks, TinySite encourages a separation of concerns where a project is composed of: (1) a static or dynamic content model, (2) some templated markup, (3) an application logic, and (4) a rendered stylesheet.
